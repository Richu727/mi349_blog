    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Aiden Bettig and I am the author of this blog. I wanted to start this blog because (insert reason here) and I am very excited to share about what I enjoy! Most of my time during the week is spent towards schoolwork and spending time with family. I help coach a volleyball team back at home that my sisters are on, and I really enjoy playing myself! Last year I was on MSU's volleyball team and played middle blocker (one of the hardest positions btw). I hope you'll enjoy reading about my life and how I go about my weeks!</p>
