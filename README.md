This is a blog website for the MI 349 class (FS24). It will include a home page, about page, and contact page. Each HTML should have the same header section and navigation section structure (because they are apart of the same site).
You should be able to navigate (click between) the three pages using the navigation.
The index.html file should include two original blog posts (on any topic you'd like).
  Each blog post should be at least 200 words and contain 1 image, a title, a published date, and author.
The about.html file should include a bio of the author.
  The bio should include paragraphs, at least one list, and one image.
In contact.html, create a contact form with the following fields:
  For now, just add a heading to your contactd page. We'll add more to this page in the next lab.
Make sure the structure and typography are marked up using the proper HTML5 tags.
  Hint: there are additional tags for dates, authors, and other metadata associated with content--check the documentation.
Both of your HTML pages should validate.
Your final website should be deployed to Netfliy as a new URL.
