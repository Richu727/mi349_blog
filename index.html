            <h2>October 11th, 2024</h2>
            <p>Today I wanted to talk about how I want to stop using social media as a news source and what thing I can replace that bad habit with. So what I want to do is change my behavior of scrolling and getting sucked into an online transe. But I can't just get rid of a bad habit, so I want to replace it with a good one, and a suitable way to get information about current events without looking at any social media. Current events isn't particularly important to me in the first place, so I would probably just ask my friends and family for anything that has been happening recently, and get their opinions. Obviously I want to be discerning because of bias they may have, but what even are news channels nowadays besides biased. I think engaging in converations with people about topics will be more entertaining, and will give me a chance to get better at forming opinions on the spot, along with training me to ask good questions to further the conversation. A lot of people get their ideas from the internet and just regurgitate what they have seen online, so I think it's important to form your own opinions based on truth, rather than whatever goop social media feeding everyone. Hopefully, disconnecting from billions of opinions and allowing myself to think in a conversation will help me become more independent and not rely on others to hold my beliefs. For my physical goals, I want to have a meaningful conversation with a friend or family member every single day, and have the mindset of learning one new thing, either about them, or current news. I want to consciously direct the conversation towards news they've read online, or something that's been going on in their life. And hopefully I will be able to have at least one of these conversations per day.</p>
